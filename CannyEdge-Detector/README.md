# CannyEdge-Detector
A popular edge detection algorithm that is widely used in computer vision and image processing to identify edges in images with high accuracy and low error rates. The detector aims to detect meaningful edges while minimizing noise and false detections.

In the class method Hysteresis, the other image names: img2, mg3, img4 can be ignored to get the same output.

The image can be changed to whatever path that houses your image.
